Hello geeks!

This is my 4th java project.
The project is a Tic Tac Toe game that you can play with someone else that is 
connected to the same server.



Important :
1/ RUN the Server in the first place
	java -jar TicTacToeGameArbani__Server.jar
2/ RUN the client using : 
	java -jar TicTacToeGameArbani__Client.jar
